Hey there, future physicists! Today we're

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:06,356
diving into Scalars and Vectors.

3
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,143
Scalar having magnitude But not have Direction

4
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:20,606
like east west south and north

5
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:25,923
vector having magnitude and also specified Direction

6
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:28,408
like east west south and north

7
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:32,584
some of scalar quantity example are:

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,728
Thermometer

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,053
speedometer

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,338
Weight scale

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,270
Introduction to vector

12
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,405
Vectors, on the other hand, are a bit

13
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:56,963
more demanding.They have both magnitude and direction.

14
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,510
some of example of vector are:

15
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:11,612
wind flows in specified direction

16
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,944
Arrow moving toward target

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,270
the line represent the numerical value called magnitude

18
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:35,731
arrow represent the direction

19
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,165
Scalar addition is a algerabic addition

20
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,974
Addition of vector A and B is:

21
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,284
In vector addition, the resultant vector is equal to the

22
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:05,047
tail of first vector to the tip of second vector.

23
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,402
line represent resultant magnititude and arrow represent direction

24
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:22,352
On multiple the above vector with scalar 2 unit

25
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,918
vector magnitude increase by 2 times

26
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:37,098
similarly, vector magnitude decrease by multiplying them

27
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,589
with scalars between 0 to 1

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,128
Its direction change in opposite direction

29
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,989
on multiply by negative scalar

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,715
Same magnitude but different directions

31
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,944
means they're different vectors.

32
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,012
This blue vector represent you are moving

33
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:12,926
in a east direction with some magnitude

34
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,074
yellow vector represent you are moving in

35
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,909
a north direction with same magnitude
